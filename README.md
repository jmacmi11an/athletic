# The Athletic Fullstack Take Home Challenge

There should be two folders inside, one for a backend server and one for a frontend React app. Please refer to the `README` in both folders for more information, e.g., wireframe.

## Challenge tasks

<!-- Done! An article page appears, has pretty neutral style, and looks alright at 3 breakpoints. -->
1. Create a page to render the article.

<!-- Done! Check the resolvers. I also added a slice based on an offset and limit for pagination --> 
2. Create a query in the Apollo server that returns a reverse chronological list of articles for one or more teams and/or leagues.

<!-- Done! A Modal pops up, shows teams or leagues dropdowns and updates accordingly. ToDo: Style the modal  -->
3. Create a page in the app that allows a user to select teams and/or leagues to follow, and renders a feed of articles for those teams/leagues. 
  - Note: The Teams function is merely an example of how to wire up a query, this can be discarded if not needed in your response.

## Bonus tasks

Please note the bonus tasks are not sorted in any particular order, and itâ€™s up to you to do some (or do all/none) in whichever order you think makes sense.

<!-- Done!  -->
1. Add pagination to the article feed.
<!-- Done! Did it using Nodemon. -->
2. Implement hot reloading for the Apollo server.

3. Write tests for the Apollo server.
4. Write tests for the React application.
<!-- I think I started this, though I'm not sure how to check. -->
5. Add caching to the Apollo server to prevent calls to the REST API on every request.

Return your challenge in a shared folder with the two folders inside, do not bundle `node_modules` with either to keep the size down.
